### Web Application Mimicking Google Sheets
**Zeotap Software Engineer Intern Assignment 1**

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a web-based spreadsheet application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It mimics the basic functionalities of Google Sheets, supporting mathematical operations, data quality functions, and data entry validations.

---

## 🔑 Features
### 1. Spreadsheet Interface
- Grid layout resembling Google Sheets.
- Toolbar with options:
  - Bold
  - Italics
  - Font Size
  - Text Color
- Add/Delete Rows and Columns.
- Resizable Columns.
- Drag-and-Drop Cell Selection.

### 2. Mathematical Functions
- `SUM`: Calculates the sum of selected cells.
- `AVERAGE`: Calculates the average of selected cells.
- `MAX`: Returns the highest value from selected cells.
- `MIN`: Returns the lowest value from selected cells.
- `COUNT`: Counts the number of numeric cells.

### 3. Data Quality Functions
- `TRIM`: Removes whitespace from text cells.
- `UPPER`: Converts text to uppercase.
- `LOWER`: Converts text to lowercase.
- `REMOVE_DUPLICATES`: Removes duplicate rows.
- `FIND_AND_REPLACE`: Finds and replaces text within cells.

### 4. Data Entry & Validation
- Supports Text, Numbers, and Dates.
- Numeric cells only accept numbers.
